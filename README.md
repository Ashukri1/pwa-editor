# Text Editor Starter Code
The recent challenge focused on developing a Progressive Web App (PWA) text editor. Participants were tasked with refactoring the provided starter code to create a single-page text editor that operates seamlessly in a browser environment. The key objectives of the challenge were to meet PWA criteria, ensure data persistence for redundancy, and enable offline functionality.

To fulfill the requirements, participants had to utilize IndexedDB, a powerful browser-based database, for storing and retrieving data. They were also expected to bundle the JavaScript files using webpack, a popular module bundler. Additionally, generating a manifest file from webpack was necessary to enhance the PWA capabilities of the text editor.
